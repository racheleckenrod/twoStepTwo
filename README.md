Up dating the README in the other branch shows that it is not related to this history. 

Here is a copy of the README:



I assume git will find the other README.md file and add this entry to it.

this branch is headfix and the README here is/was the txt file I thought I ha seen, but did not create. In it I said I was going to copy/past the contents of it into this file... etc and I'll go do that now.

A new responsive template featuring a flat (but not too flat) minimalistic design, spacious layout, and styling for all basic page elements.

	Fixing a million detached heads isn't that fun, oh how I wish I had not listened to other 
	people when deleting what I made..
this could be part two of finding the heroku branch if it even works that way, looks like this 
headfix branch I am on does not get pushed to heroku and the heroku/headfix does, or might.. ? 
i am certainly going to try.
Days later I am back with a much more advanced perspective on working with git. I am now noticing that this HEADfix does not include my readme and this readme is the old .txt file. so I am going to make a copy/paste of this text, and put it in a new file that i can only assume at this point will be connected up to the old one whether I like it or not, so just as I b put a txt file up in the FREEDOM branch an hour or so ago now, I am going to double up on READme's in this HEAD fix branch. I have a new deployment already up at heroku of the linked chat site- that really is only temporary anyway....

I am glad I hung on to all this info so I understand and can choose wisely how to proceed. Removing files here..

****** end of copy/paste from exsisting README.txt file..****

back to deleting unneeded/wanted file, renaming some to reduce confusion and preparing for the updated chat room and lobby experience.

the pictures being displayed in the profile page have those bullet point on them in this version

(on a side note, I really want to have those links working on the chat site...) (sessions, authemtication)

not sure why I have the post.ejs and a post2.ejs, but I am keeping them for now..

I would like to take this README with me to the new repo.

It appears that some of the things I dealt with have to do with in this project have to do with my personal accounts
having been hacked in some way. ???
